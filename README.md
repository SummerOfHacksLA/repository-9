Motorcy.co
============
As a regular motorcycle commuter, I would love to see more data on my riding style, appropriate speeds, road conditions, traffic, etc. If you are not riding in a group it is difficult to get this feedback. Motorcy.co maps your ride, provides data on your riding style and shows your performance in different segments. It compares your rides to other in the same ‘Type’ category. Seeing the data from each ride helps you to improve your riding style to become safer, defensive and fun. SAFE RIDING.
